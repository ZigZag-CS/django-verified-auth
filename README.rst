=======

Django Verified Authentication provides a Django app to explicitly
handle user email verification. The app provides models, views, a set of
:code:`urlpatterns` and an Authentication Backend to provide this
functionality. Email verification may be enforced at registration, or
developers may opt to allow users to access the application without
verifying their email.
